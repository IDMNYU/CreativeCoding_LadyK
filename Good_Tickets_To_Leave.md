Examples of Good Tickets To Leave


(0,0) is the top-leftmost point, and the size is measured in pixels.
[1:46 PM]The x-coordinate increases to the right, and the y-coordinate increases downwards.
[1:47 PM]The objects can overlap depending on the order of the code.

I learned how to create a sketch, by determining its size by passing in width and height parameters (measured in pixels. The line of code is size(width, height); (always remembering the semicolon at the end for it to be able to run)i learned about the fill function, which fills a shape with a specific colored determined by the rgb value passed in. If it's just one number like 0, it would be black, and if its 255, it would be white.I learned about the order of operations of filling in a shape with a color. The fill function should be implemented above the creation of the shape.

Learned:
1. when creating the basic background for the rest of your code to show up, the origin starts at (0,0), but it is the upper left corner of whatever size canvas you are creating, instead of the center
2. color for items in your code can be arranged as (r,g,b), aka red, green, and blue, and each value at its max is 255 and its min is 0
3. you can change the opacity of shapes (also known as alpha) after inputting the color value for the shape: ex:
fill(0,255,0,80);
rect(0,150,150,120);.
Questions:
1. Instead of using // to comment out every line of code, is /* */ more useful?
2. Are both texts available in the bookstore?
3. Does the name of the general folder we save work to matter or only the exact file name?

I've learned that I should use the reference guide for the processing coding and get used understanding the coordinate and color system based on the examples from class.We should think like the computer in the sense that the code is running from top to bottom and if the sequencing isn't right, it is easy to mess up, and an easy way to see what went wrong is to comment out sections to see what may need to be fixed.One thing that isn't too relevant but I'm curious and want to learn about is what exactly does it mean that our code is static mode, and what is considered or what happens if i
