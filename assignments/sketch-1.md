# Sketch 1

## **Due**&#x20;



**Submit on openProcessing**

_Come to class on September tba with the sketch started and we will demo how to submit it together in class_

I am looking to see how well you understand:

* screen coordinates
* shapes
* creating different shapes in a number of ways - layering, begin/end shape, building shapes with other shapes
* color
* opacity
* layering - NOTE ALL THE LAYERS
* your strategies on creating difficult shapes - This doesn't mean you must do every complex shape. Yet, you must show me how you would tackle such shapes with completion on 1
* how well your eye sees the many layers of this painting.

Recommendations: Do not do this in one sitting. Take breaks. Work on this in several sessions (and not the night before it's due).



**Key aspects:**



* Think: density and diversity of shapes. Take up the entire sketch window
* Notice the layering of shapes and how opacity works
* On the [https://processing.org/reference/](https://processing.org/reference/), utilize the listings under: 2D Primitives, Curves, Attributes, Vertex, and Color
* Use a variety of different shapes (at least 7), and different sizes (experiment!)
* Create your own shapes using beginShape(), vertex(), endShape()
* Play with opacity
* When you are playing with opacity, also play with layering shapes on top of one another
* Understanding screen coordinates (where to place the shapes), creating shapes, using color, opacity are key here in building your compositions
* Your sketch size must be 800 x 800 pixels
* Your code must yield the final result. It is not user generated (ie, mouse values, key values) and it is not randomly generated.
* See something in the painting that you aren't sure how to replicate in code? Be creative! Think diversively! What techniques can you put together?
* Do not avoid the complicated bits. It's better to make an attempt than nothing at all.
* I want to see how good your sense of observation is. How many layers do you notice in the painting?

**Tips:**



* [Useful resources for curves (switch tab to playground)](http://yining1023.github.io/p5PlayGround/)
* [Tutorial on Curves](https://processing.org/tutorials/curves/)
* [Find your colors and your color groove here.](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)
* Drawing out your composition on graph paper first, will help you understand coordinates. Make the top left corner (0, 0)
* Creating an interactive cross-hairs (see example sketches given in class and the Slack channel Code From Class)
