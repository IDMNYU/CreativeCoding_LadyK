## **Due September 19th 2025 - uploaded to our class page on openProcessing and submitted under "Sketch 1" by NOON on Friday the 19th.**

### Write code to generate a tiling pattern or textural composition, as for wallpaper or fabric. Give consideration to aesthetic issues like symmetry, rhythm, color; detail at multiple scales; precise control of shape; and the balance between organic and geometric forms.

### Your pattern should be designed so that it could be infinitely tiles or extended. Design something you would like to put on the walls or floor of your home, or you could imagine yourself wearing.

### You are encouraged to sketch it out first

#### **Learning Objectives**

* **Create visual designs using the Cartesian coordinate system and combining drawing functions**
* **Use functional abstraction to encapsulate the code for modular design elements**
* **Generate and critique design symmetries and/or seamless repetition**

_Come to class on September 15 with the sketch started and we will demo how to submit it together in class_

I am looking to see how well you understand:

* screen coordinates
* shapes
* creating different shapes in a number of ways - layering, begin/end shape, building shapes with other shapes
* color
* opacity
* layering - NOTE ALL THE LAYERS
* your strategies on creating difficult shapes - This doesn't mean you must do every complex shape. Yet, you must show me how you would tackle such shapes with completion on 1



Recommendations: Do not do this in one sitting. Take breaks. Work on this in several sessions (and not the night before it's due).



**Key aspects:**



* Think: density and diversity of shapes. Take up the entire sketch window
* Notice the layering of shapes and how opacity works
* On the [https://processing.org/reference/](https://processing.org/reference/), utilize the listings under: 2D Primitives, Curves, Attributes, Vertex, and Color
* Use a variety of different shapes (at least 7), and different sizes (experiment!)
* Create your own shapes using beginShape(), vertex(), endShape()
* Play with opacity
* When you are playing with opacity, also play with layering shapes on top of one another
* Understanding screen coordinates (where to place the shapes), creating shapes, using color, opacity are key here in building your compositions
* Your sketch size must be 800 x 800 pixels
* Your code must yield the final result. It is not user generated (ie, mouse values, key values) and it is not randomly generated.

**Tips:**



* [Useful resources for curves (switch tab to playground)](http://yining1023.github.io/p5PlayGround/)
* [Tutorial on Curves](https://processing.org/tutorials/curves/)
* [Find your colors and your color groove here.](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)
* Drawing out your composition on graph paper first, will help you understand coordinates. Make the top left corner (0, 0)
* Creating an interactive cross-hairs (see example sketches given in class and the Slack channel Code From Class)
