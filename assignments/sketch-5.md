### Sketch 5: Wallpaper Options

Your mom comes to you with a quest: She wants to re-wallpaper her office and she wants you to design the wallpaper! **She LOVES Moroccan & Egyptian Tiles!**&#x20;

![Inspired by Ancient Egyptian colors and tiles](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s3ks8j1jw6M/UASekhqS0BI/AAAAAAAAkRQ/oIW8a5qraS0/s1600/Egypt-047.jpg)

Create 3-4 design variations to show her. Hint: use variables to vary the output!&#x20;

You are challenged to create these designs in code! Once can 'hard code' this. But this is a creative coding class in Week 4/5! You know a bunch of techniques that can be used to help you iterate a pattern. Work to exercise your programming knowledge!&#x20;

## **I am looking specifically at how you can manipulate and get more mileage and variation out of your code.**

&#x20;&#x20;

**Suggested Plan of Action:**

&#x20; 0\. Create a pattern

1. Put it in a custom function that passes parameters for location and other attributes. Test it.
2. Get familiar with a for-loop, and calling that function within a for-loop.
3. Call that particular for-loop within ANOTHER For-loop to create a grid!

Bonus: use if-statements within your for-loops to get more mileage and variation out of your designs. Hint: Link the if-statements to how the for-loop iterates!

Variables, loops, and exit conditions are your key. Play and experiment here. Try different things out. Play with your operators in your for-loop (+, -, \*, /), as well as how much you are operating by (ie, +1, -2, /.5, \*5.5).

Consider different rhythms that you can make with spacing, direction/orientation and repetition. Use a keyPress to switch between different patterns. As a result, all of your patterns should appear in ONE sketch
