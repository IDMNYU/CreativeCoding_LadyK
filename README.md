## Creative Coding: An Intro to Creative Coding <a href="#less-than-h1-style-font-size-50px-greater-than-less-than-h1-greater-than" id="less-than-h1-style-font-size-50px-greater-than-less-than-h1-greater-than"></a>

**Syllabus is subject to change at any time. Check back regularly.**

This course is an introductory programming class, appropriate for students with no programming experience, who are interested in creating interactivity. At the same time, it's a course for students with programming experience to get experience programming graphic, interactive, dynamic applications. Traditionally, introductory programming teaches algorithmic problem-solving, where a sequence of instructions describe the steps necessary to achieve a desired result. In this course, students are trained to go beyond this sequential thinking - to think concurrently and modularly. By its end, students are empowered to write and read code for creating interactivity including: event-driven creative applications, interactive installations, graphical user interfaces, games and user interfaces. Interactivity will be introduced and discussed throughout.

## Program Goals

This course reinforces the IDM Program goals by

• Integrate multiple mediums of image, text, sound, physical, space, and interactivity. (Reinforced)

• Adapt to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn. Skills acquisition.

• Combine research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration. (Reinforced)

• Collaborate across disciplines.

• Adopt and use professional practices. (Reinforced)

• Integrate Cultural Literacy

• Adapt to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn. Skills acquisition.
