# Final Course Deliverables

## Self Assessment

Using Word or another text editor, reflect on the following, **considering the entire semester** not just your Final Project:

• _**Critically analyze/evaluate how much time was spent learning syntax & structure, programming concepts vs. actually programming, and how does this reflect on the final quality of your end result.**_

• _**Comment on your successes and frustrations with Processing and P5.js.**_

• _**Compare and contrast OOP versus Procedural Programming. How are they similiar? How are they different?**_ I am looking for you to explain this in your own words, what these concepts are. I am NOT looking for you to tell me how you used these in your project.

• _**Specifically considering your final project: What programming concepts solidified in your final project? What did you learn with reference to programming? Did you have a break through?**_

• _**Specifically considering your final project: Were you able to resolve your own bugs? What tricks did you learn in the process to help? Did you do any debugging?**_

• What was your intended milestone? Did you make it? Did another one pop up? Tell me about this. Tell me how you resolved it.

• What are you _most_ proud of, with reference to your final project?

• _**How do you think you'll move forward with programming? will you keep doing it ? How does this relate to other classes you are either taking or wish to take?**_

## Letter to the Next Cohort

• Write a letter to the next class or create a 1-2 minute video (.mov, .mp4, etc), giving them advice on how to reach their learning goals and get value out of this course. Send me this document via Slack Direct message

• Submit any missing exercises to get credit for them. Post them to github and EMAIL me that they are up.

## All of the above must be submitted by May 12 16:00
